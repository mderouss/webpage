Usage: webpage [-h] [-v] [-f <flags> ] [-c <abs path to html root>] [-n navembedcode] <markdown file>

Broadly speaking, the expectation is that this tool will be used as part of a script that
traverses a directory hierarchy containing md files and converts them to html. In particular,
it's expected that the markdown file resides in the current working directory, and that this
directory is underneath html root ( yes, html root not markdown root ).

 -h                        : print this help
 -v                        : output verbose information
 -f <flags>                : <flags> are bitwise as follows -
                           : 0x01 - omit DOCTYPE 
                           : 0x02 - omit title 
                           : 0x04 - omit datetime
                           : 0x08 - omit author
 -c <abs path to html root>: Enables linking to css file. File linked will be first found
                             searching from cwd towards html root. NB Requires an absolute,
                             not relative, path.
 -n <navembedcode>         : Provide for ability to tack a special embedding on to the body for
                             navigation purposes.
 <markdown file>           : File containing Commonmark markdown. Beware of complications if
                             this file is not in the cwd, particularly if using the 'c' option.
